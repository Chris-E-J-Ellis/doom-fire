# Doom Fire in WPF

A version of the Doom Fire effect, inspired by the excellent article by [Fabien Sanglard](http://fabiensanglard.net/doom_fire_psx/)

## Notes
- There's loads of shared state, some dicey potential threading issues, and some other oddities in here.
- Most of the interesting "Fun" parts from the article are in "StepFire" and "SpreadFire".
- This isn't a kind way to treat a WPF form, but it is fun to play around with. 
- Enjoy!
